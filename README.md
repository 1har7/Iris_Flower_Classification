# Iris_Flower_Classification

The Iris Flower Classification project is a Python-based machine learning effort to classify iris flowers into three species—*Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*—using the classic Iris dataset. Leveraging Logistic Regression, the model analyzes four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) after preprocessing, including normalization and a 75-25 train-test split. Visualizations with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib reveal feature distributions, while the model achieves 81.58% test accuracy. This project highlights data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, offering a solid foundation for learning classification techniques and exploring advanced algorithms like SVM or Random Forest for improved accuracy.
